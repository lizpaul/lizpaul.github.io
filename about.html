		<p>A few weeks ago I was out at a bar, and I overheard a conversation I’ve had increasingly more often with myself over the last year. A bearded Brit behind me said to his friend, “My dream is to be on a beach somewhere, sipping a Gin and Tonic, typing away on my laptop for my freelance programming gig.” Just replace his G &amp; Tonic with a French 75, and this is me.</p>
		
		<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for software engineers is projected to grow a staggering 24% by 2026. Chat with any high-and-tight sporting bro wearing Birkestocks and you'll know about his office's beer fridges, work from home policy, and, most importantly, bring your dog to work day (spoiler alert: it's everyday). So I'm jumping on the developer bandwagon.</p>

		<p>I'm starting this blog to document my dive into coding. Over the next few months (years?) I'm going to attempt to:</p>

		<p>learn how to code</p>
		<p>learn how to decode coding culture</p>
		<p>find my bliss on a beach somewhere, French 75 in hand, typing away on my laptop for my freelance programming gig.</p>

		<p> So cheers to the dream and wish me luck. Let's see how it goes.</p>
